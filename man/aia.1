aia \- command\-line AI assistant
.SH SYNOPSIS
.PP
aia \[lB]options\[rB]* PROMPT\[ru]ID \[lB]CONTEXT\[ru]FILE\[rB]*
.SH DESCRIPTION
.PP
The aia command\-line tool is an interface for interacting with AI models, facilitating the management of pre\-compositional prompts and executing generative AI commands\. It supports various options to customize interactions, load configuration files, and integrate shell and ERB for dynamic content\.
.SH ARGUMENTS
.TP
\fIPROMPT\[ru]ID\fP
This is a required argument\.
.TP
\fICONTEXT\[ru]FILES\fP
This is an optional argument\.  One or more files can be added to the prompt as context for the LLM to process\.
.SH OPTIONS
.TP
\fB\-\-chat\fR
begin a chat session with the LLM after the initial prompt response;  will set \-\-no\-out\[ru]file so that the LLM response comes to STDOUT\.  After the initial prompt is processed, you will be asked to provide a follow up\.  Just enter whatever is appropriate terminating your input with a RETURN\.  The LLM will provide a response to your follow up and ask you again if you have another follow up\. This back and forth chatting will continue until you enter \fBexit\fR or a control\-D to terminate the session\.  You may also enter a directive to be processed after which another follow up is requested\.  If you have the \fB\-\-shell\fR and\[sl]or the \fB\-\-erb\fR options set you may use those tools within your follow up to provide dynamic content durning your chat session\.
.TP
\fB\-\-completion\fR \fISHELL\[ru]NAME\fP
.TP
\fB\-\-dump\fR \fIPATH\[sl]TO\[sl]FILE\.ext\fP
Dump the current configuration to a file in the format denoted by the file\[cq]s extension\.  Currently only \.yml, \.yaml and \.toml are acceptable file extensions\.  \fIIf the file exists, it will be over\-written without warning\.\fP
.TP
\fB\-\-shell\fR
Enables \fBaia\fR to access your terminal\[cq]s shell environment from inside the prompt text, allowing for dynamic content insertion using system environment variables and shell commands\.
.TP
\fB\-\-erb\fR

Load Config File\. both YAML and TOML formats are supported\.  Also ERB is supported\.  For example \[ti]\[sl]aia\[ru]config\.yml\.erb will be processed through ERB and then through YAML\.  The result will be written out to \[ti]\[sl]aia\[ru]config\.yml so that you can manually verify that you got what you wanted from the ERB processing\.
.TP

.SH CONFIGURATION HIERARCHY
.PP
System Environment Variables (envars) that are all uppercase and begin with \[lq]AIA\[ru]\[rq] can be used to over\-ride the default configuration settings\.  For example setting \[lq]export AIA\[ru]PROMPTS\[ru]DIR\[eq]\[ti]\[sl]Documents\[sl]prompts\[rq] will over\-ride the default configuration; however, a config value provided by a command line options will over\-ride an envar setting\.
.PP
Configuration values found in a config file will override all other values set for a config item\.
.PP
\[rq]\[sl]\[sl]config\[rq] directives found inside a prompt file override that config item regardless of where the value was set\.
.PP
For example, \[lq]\[sl]\[sl]config chat? \[eq] true\[rq] within a prompt will set up the chat session for that specific prompt regardless of the command line options or the envar AIA\[ru]CHAT settings\.
.SH OpenAI ACCOUNT IS REQUIRED
.PP
Additionally, the program requires an OpenAI access key, which can be specified using one of the following environment variables:
.RS
.IP \(bu 2
\fBOPENAI\[ru]ACCESS\[ru]TOKEN\fR
.IP \(bu 2
\fBOPENAI\[ru]API\[ru]KEY\fR
.RE
.PP
Currently there is not specific standard for name of the OpenAI key\.  Some programs use one name, while others use a different name\.  Both of the envars listed above mean the same thing\.  If you use more than one tool to access OpenAI resources, you may have to set several envars to the same key value\.
.PP
To acquire an OpenAI access key, first create an account on the OpenAI platform, where further documentation is available\.
.SH USAGE NOTES
.PP
\fBaia\fR is designed for flexibility, allowing users to pass prompt ids and context files as arguments\. Some options change the behavior of the output, such as \fB\-\-out\[ru]file\fR for specifying a file or \fB\-\-no\-out\[ru]file\fR for disabling file output in favor of standard output (STDPIT)\.
.PP
The \fB\-\-completion\fR option displays a script that enables prompt ID auto\-completion for bash, zsh, or fish shells\. It\[cq]s crucial to integrate the script into the shell\[cq]s runtime to take effect\.
.PP
The \fB\-\-dump path\[sl]to\[sl]file\.ext\fR option will write the current configuration to a file in the format requested by the file\[cq]s extension\.  The following extensions are supported:  \.yml, \.yaml and \.toml
.SH PROMPT DIRECTIVES
.PP
Within a prompt text file any line that begins with \[lq]\[sl]\[sl]\[rq] is considered a prompt directive\.  There are numerious prompt directives available\.  In the discussion above on the configuration you learned about the \[lq]\[sl]\[sl]config\[rq] directive\.
.PP
Prompt directives are lines in the prompt text file that begin with \[lq]\[sl]\[sl]\[rq] and are used to tailor the specific configuration environment for the prompt\. Some directives include:
.RS
.IP \(bu 2
\fB\[sl]\[sl]config item value\fR: Sets configuration items for a specific prompt\.
.IP \(bu 2
\fB\[sl]\[sl]include path\[ru]to\[ru]file\fR: Includes the content of a specified file into the prompt\.
.IP \(bu 2
\fB\[sl]\[sl]ruby ruby\[ru]code\fR: Executes Ruby code and includes the result in the prompt\.
.IP \(bu 2
\fB\[sl]\[sl]shell shell\[ru]command\fR: Executes a shell command and includes the output in the prompt\.
.RE
.SH Prompt Sequences
.PP
The \fB\-\-next\fR and \fB\-\-pipeline\fR command line options allow for the sequencing of prompts such that the first prompt\[cq]s response feeds into the second prompt\[cq]s context and so on\.  Suppose you had a complex sequence of prompts with IDs one, two, three and four\.  You would use the following \fBaia\fR command to process them in sequence:
.PP
\fBaia one \-\-pipeline two,three,four\fR
.PP
Notice that the value for the pipelined prompt IDs has no spaces\.  This is so that the command line parser does not mistake one of the promp IDs as a CLI option and issue an error\.
.SS Prompt Sequences Inside of a Prompt File
.PP
You can also use the \fBconfig\fR directive inside of a prompt file to specify a sequence\.  Given the example above of 4 prompt IDs you could add this directive to the prompt file \fBone\.txt\fR
.PP
\fB\[sl]\[sl]config next two\fR
.PP
Then inside the prompt file \fBtwo\.txt\fR you could use this directive:
.PP
\fB\[sl]\[sl]config pipeline three,four\fR
.PP
or just
.PP
\fB\[sl]\[sl]config next three\fR
.PP
if you want to specify them one at a time\.
.PP
You can also use the shortcuts \fB\[sl]\[sl]next\fR and \fB\[sl]\[sl]pipeline\fR

.RE
.SH Image Generation
.PP
aia supports image generation using the \fBdall\-e\-2\fR and \fBdall\-e\-3\fR models through OpenAI\.  The result of your prompt will be a URL that points to the OpenAI storage space where your image is placed\.
.PP
Use \-\-image\[ru]size and \-\-image\[ru]quality to specified the desired size and quality of the generated image\.  The valid values are available at the OpenAI website\.
