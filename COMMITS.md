* Only provide a multi-line message when the change is non-trivial.
* For example, a few lines changed is trivial. Prefer a single-line message.
* Most changes under 100 lines changed are trivial and only need a single-line message.
* Never use an emoji in the commit message
* Say why a change was made not just what the change was
