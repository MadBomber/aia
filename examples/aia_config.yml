# AIA configuration for example demos
# Used by all demo scripts via: aia -c aia_config.yml ...
#
# This file is loaded with the -c / --config-file flag.
# It replaces the user's personal config (~/.config/aia/aia.yml),
# starting from bundled defaults + these values only.
# CLI flags passed directly to aia still take precedence.
#
# NOTE: Relative paths resolve against the directory where aia is invoked.
#       Run demo scripts from the examples/ directory.
