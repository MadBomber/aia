#!/usr/bin/env aia run --no-out_file --exec
# NOTE: the --exec option is REQUIRED to run this executable prompt file
#       This option signals that the contents of this file are to be appended
#       to the contents of the given prompt ID file.  In this case it is the
#       "run" prompt ID's text file.
#
#       All other AIA options are, well, optional.  The --no-out_file is
#       used here to cause the response to this executable prompt to be
#       sent to STDOUT like a good little *nix CLI tool.  Its not necessary.
#       if you do not use it, the output will go to the default out_file.
#       You could also specify a specific file to write the output to built
#       but it is more convential to use the *nix STDOUT redirect "> output.md"

# Desc: retrieves the news.google.com website
#       extracts and formats the headlines
#       and prints them to STDOUT
#

#   the shell or ERB integration.  For this example lets use
#   a built-in directive.
