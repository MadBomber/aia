    description <<~DESCRIPTION
      Comprehensive DevOps and system administration toolkit for managing application deployments,
      monitoring system health, and performing operational tasks across different environments.
      This tool provides secure, audited access to common DevOps operations including deployments,
      rollbacks, health checks, log analysis, and metrics collection. It includes built-in safety
      mechanisms for production environments, comprehensive logging for compliance, and support
      for multiple deployment environments. All operations are logged and require appropriate
      permissions and confirmations for sensitive environments.
    DESCRIPTION

    param :operation,
          desc: <<~DESC,
            Specific DevOps operation to perform:
            - 'deploy': Deploy application code to the specified environment
            - 'rollback': Revert to the previous stable deployment version
            - 'health_check': Perform comprehensive health and status checks
            - 'log_analysis': Analyze application and system logs for issues
            - 'metric_collection': Gather and report system and application metrics
            Each operation has specific requirements and safety checks.
          DESC
          type: :string,
          required: true,
          enum: ["deploy", "rollback", "health_check", "log_analysis", "metric_collection"]

    param :environment,
          desc: <<~DESC,
            Target environment for the DevOps operation:
            - 'development': Local or shared development environment (minimal restrictions)
            - 'staging': Pre-production environment for testing (moderate restrictions)
            - 'production': Live production environment (maximum restrictions and confirmations)
            Production operations require explicit confirmation via the 'production_confirmed' option.
          DESC
          type: :string,
          default: "staging",
          enum: ["development", "staging", "production"]

    param :options,
          desc: <<~DESC,
            Hash of operation-specific options and parameters:
            - For deploy: version, branch, rollback_on_failure, notification_channels
            - For rollback: target_version, confirmation_required
            - For health_check: services_to_check, timeout_seconds
            - For log_analysis: time_range, log_level, search_patterns
            - For metric_collection: metric_types, time_window, output_format
            Production operations require 'production_confirmed: true' for safety.
          DESC
          type: :hash,
          default: {}
