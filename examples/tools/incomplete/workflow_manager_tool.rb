    description <<~DESCRIPTION
      Manage complex multi-step workflows with persistent state tracking across tool invocations.
      This tool enables the creation and management of stateful workflows that can span multiple
      AI interactions and tool calls. It provides workflow initialization, step-by-step execution,
      status monitoring, and completion tracking. Each workflow maintains its state in persistent
      storage, allowing for resumption of long-running processes and coordination between
      multiple tools and AI interactions. Perfect for complex automation tasks that require
      multiple stages and decision points.
    DESCRIPTION

    param :action,
          desc: <<~DESC,
            Workflow management action to perform:
            - 'start': Initialize a new workflow with initial data and return workflow ID
            - 'step': Execute the next step in an existing workflow using provided step data
            - 'status': Check the current status and progress of an existing workflow
            - 'complete': Mark a workflow as finished and clean up associated resources
            Each action requires different combinations of the other parameters.
          DESC
          type: :string,
          required: true,
          enum: ["start", "step", "status", "complete"]

    param :workflow_id,
          desc: <<~DESC,
            Unique identifier for an existing workflow. Required for 'step', 'status', and 'complete'
            actions. This ID is returned when starting a new workflow and should be used for all
            subsequent operations on that workflow. The ID is a UUID string that ensures
            uniqueness across all workflow instances.
          DESC
          type: :string

    param :step_data,
          desc: <<~DESC,
            Hash containing data and parameters specific to the current workflow step.
            For 'start' action: Initial configuration and parameters for the workflow.
            For 'step' action: Input data, parameters, and context needed for the next step.
            The structure depends on the specific workflow type and current step requirements.
            Can include nested hashes, arrays, and any JSON-serializable data types.
