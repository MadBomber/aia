I have a JSON document with the following structure:

<%= JSON.pretty_generate({ "project" => "aia", "version" => "1.0.0-beta", "languages" => ["Ruby"], "features" => ["prompt management", "multi-model", "directives", "pipelines"] }) %>

Summarize what this project does in two sentences based on the JSON above.
