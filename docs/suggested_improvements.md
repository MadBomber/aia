# Suggested Improvements

## General Improvements
1. **Refactoring and Cleanup:**
   - **Legacy Code**: There are remnants of older methods that seem commented out or marked as TODO, like `process_directives` in `main.rb`. Consider removing unused or fully commented sections of code to avoid confusion.
   - **File Consistency**: Ensure each file ends with a newline character, as it's a common convention that can prevent certain issues in scripting and when working with various text editors.

2. **Error Handling:**
   - Review all error handling approaches. For instance, error handling using exceptions should be clear and capture possible errors comprehensively without leaking unnecessary information to end-users.
   - Use rescue blocks to log and gracefully handle errors rather than allowing abrupt script termination.

## Code Structure and Best Practices
3. **Modularization:**
   - **Methods Clarification**: Some comments suggest unresolved method functionalities, like `get_and_display_result` mentioned twice in `prompt_processor.rb`. Clarifying intended uses and ensuring separation of concerns is vital, possibly requiring further modular decomposition or clarification in documentation.
   - **Single Responsibility Principle**: Components like `Prompt` and `Cli` appear to manage numerous tasks. Splitting these classes or modules into more focused classes could improve maintainability.

4. **Logging Enhancements:**
   - **Centralized Logging**: Ensure logging functions effectively track system behaviors and are standardized across the application. Use levels (info, error, debug) to provide clearer understandings of application flow during development and production.

5. **Testing:**
   - Expand test coverage if not comprehensive. Some test setups appear quite focused (such as mocked inputs for prompt testing), but testing broader scenarios and edge cases remains crucial for robustness.
   - Perform regular load testing if feasible, ensuring the application responds well under expected workloads.

## Documentation and Conventions
6. **Documentation:**
   - **Internal Documentation**: Expand inline comments particularly where logic might be intricate or non-intuitive. This will help future contributors understand the code's intentions easily.
   - **Tooltips or Hints**: Improvement comments, such as those regarding directives processing, should be replaced with either clarification comments or tasks in a project management tool to avoid clutter in the code.

7. **Code Style:**
   - Ensure consistent naming conventions across methods and attributes. Unified and clear naming can avoid misunderstandings and improve code readability.

## Configuration and Environment
8. **Configuration Management:**
   - Move hard-coded configuration values (like certain default directory paths) out into a configuration file or use environment variables to improve flexibility and adherence to different environments easily.

These improvements can elevate the softwareâ€™s robustness, make collaboration easier, and future enhancements less cumbersome. Prioritization should align with project timelines and objectives.
